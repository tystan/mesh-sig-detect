# Methods

## Data aquisition

The data is thanks to [curtis-murray](https://github.com/curtis-murray) at his [MedicalDevicesNLP](https://github.com/curtis-murray/MedicalDevicesNLP) repo

* Natural language processing of the TGA spontaneous reports of medical device database (DAEN)
* Each record has an estimate of P(`topic == "pain"` | `Level`, `Doc`) using hierarchical stochastic block modelling (hSBM)
* P(`topic == "pain"` | `Level`, `Doc`) estimates for each record are roughly interpreted as the proportion of the NLP analysed free text that is considered as using/describing words related to pain

And example record and processing values:

# Analysis choices:

* Data structures - cumulative vs snapshot
* Threshold choose
* How many "looks"
* how to choose alpha spending
* sample size limitations for maxsprt
